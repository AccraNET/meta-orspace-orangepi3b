## Environment
U-boot environment is a key-value storage.  
An environment variable can store a script as well.  
A default environment is built into the u-boot binary at compile time.  
An optional environment can be loaded at boot time from storage.
The default and loaded environments are merged and stored in ram, which becomes the final environment for the session.  
The environment can be modified and persisted to storage.
